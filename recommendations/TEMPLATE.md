# Recommendations — Contribute a Fact, Analysis, or Critique

This project is open to contributions of data, analysis, and criticism related to inequality. You do not need to be a researcher or academic. You need to be honest and to cite your sources.

---

## What Kinds of Contributions Are Welcome

- **New statistics** — poverty data, violence data, wealth data, health outcomes
- **New groups** — communities not yet represented in the visualization
- **Corrections** — if a fact is wrong, outdated, or misleadingly framed, say so
- **Deeper analysis** — structural explanations, historical context, policy failures
- **Intersectional analysis** — how multiple axes of inequality compound each other
- **International comparisons** — India in global context
- **Counter-arguments** — if you think a framing in this project is wrong, make the case

## Example Submission

```markdown
## Manual Scavenging

**Claim:**
An estimated 58,000 manual scavengers — people employed to clean human waste from dry latrines and open drains by hand — still exist in India despite the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act (2013). Virtually all are Dalit.

**Basis:**
[x] Caste  [x] Economic/Class

**Source:**
- [Manual Scavenging in India — Human Rights Watch, 2014](https://www.hrw.org/report/2014/08/25/cleaning-human-waste)
- [Safai Karamchari Andolan](http://www.safaikaramchariandolan.org)

**Context:**
Manual scavenging is a direct inheritance of untouchability. The work is caste-assigned, hereditary, and lethal. Sewer deaths from toxic gas exposure are systematically undercounted.
