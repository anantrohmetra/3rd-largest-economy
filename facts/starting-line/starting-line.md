# The Unequal Starting Line — Hereditary Advantage & Disadvantage

This file documents how birth circumstances — caste, religion, gender, class, region — determine life outcomes before a person has made a single choice.

## Caste as Inherited Position

- A child born Dalit inherits not only social stigma but material deprivation: their family is statistically more likely to be landless, more likely to work in manual scavenging or agriculture, less likely to own property, and more likely to experience violence.
- **27.4% of Dalits are multidimensionally poor** — the poverty is not randomly distributed, it follows the caste map.

- The 1931 Census is still the last publicly available caste-disaggregated population data. The Indian state has refused to release 2011 caste data — making it structurally impossible to measure caste-based inequality through official channels.

## Wealth as Inherited Position

- The richest **1% of Indians own 53%** of national wealth. The bottom **50% own 4.1%**.
- **358 billionaires** hold more than **700 million people combined**.
- Inherited wealth means inherited access to education, nutrition, healthcare, legal protection, and political influence. These advantages compound across generations.

## Religion as Inherited Position

- **84%** of cow vigilante violence victims were Muslim — being born Muslim in India means higher exposure to mob violence, state indifference, and legal precarity.
- **90%** of religion-based hate crimes between 2009–2019 occurred post-2014 — in the context of a majoritarian government.

## Gender & Sexuality as Inherited Position

- Being born a woman in India means statistically higher exposure to domestic violence, lower inherited property rights, lower access to formal employment, and lower wages when employed.
- Being born LGBTQ+ in India means legal non-recognition of relationships, potential family rejection, exclusion from formal economy (especially for trans people), and higher rates of mental health crisis.
- For Dalit women, both axes apply — gender and caste compound to produce some of the highest rates of violence and exclusion in the country.

## Region as Inherited Position

- Being born in a tribal belt region, the northeast, or Kashmir means being born into a political and economic periphery. Infrastructure is poorer, formal economy access is lower, and the state presence is more likely to be militarized than developmental.
- **32.6% of Scheduled Tribes** are multidimensionally poor — Adivasis are disproportionately located in resource-rich but economically marginalised geographies.

## The Compounding Effect

These axes do not add — they multiply:

| Identity Combination | Approximate Relative Disadvantage |
|---|---|
| Upper-caste, male, urban, wealthy | Starting position: advantaged |
| Lower-caste, male, rural, poor | Starting position: significantly disadvantaged |
| Dalit, female, rural, poor | Starting position: severely disadvantaged |
| Dalit, trans, rural, poor | Starting position: extreme disadvantage across every axis |

The race is not equal. The finishing line is the same — employment, safety, dignity, political voice — but the starting positions are miles apart, and the distance is not chosen.
