# Environment & Climate — Who Pollutes, Who Suffers

## Carbon Inequality

- The **poorest 50% of the world** account for just **3% of carbon emissions** associated with private capital ownership.
- The **top 10%** account for **77% of such emissions**.
- The wealthy are able to insulate themselves from climate-associated costs and risks. The poor — who emit the least — bear the most.

## Adani — Coal & Acceleration

- Gautam Adani's Adani Group has embarked on a plan to **double its coal-power production** to a total of nearly **38 GW**.
- When complete, Adani will burn **155 million tonnes** of coal per annum.
- CO₂ emissions from Adani's coal-power stations will exceed **200 million tonnes per annum**.
- Adani is the **world's biggest private developer of coal**.

## Who Suffers

Climate change does not impact all communities equally:

- Coastal and low-lying communities — disproportionately poor, Dalit, and Adivasi — face the highest exposure to flooding, cyclones, and sea-level rise.
- Agricultural communities dependent on monsoon patterns face food insecurity as climate becomes more volatile.
- Displacement from mining and dam projects already affects millions — predominantly Adivasis, who are pushed off ancestral land in the name of "development."
- Air pollution from coal plants is concentrated in regions where poor communities live, not where decision-makers do.

## The Structure

Adani's wealth is built on fossil fuel extraction. That wealth purchases political influence. Political influence shapes regulation. Regulation (or its absence) enables further extraction. The loop is closed — at the expense of those who lack the wealth to exit or insulate.
