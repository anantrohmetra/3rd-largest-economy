# Economic Inequality — Wealth, Labour & Exploitation

## Wealth Concentration

- The top 10% of India's population holds **77% of total national wealth**.
- The richest **1% own 53%** of India's wealth.
- The poorest **50% own just 4.1%** of national wealth.
- India has **358 billionaires** (2025) with a combined wealth of approximately **$1.9 trillion**.
- The total wealth of the bottom 50% (735 million people) is approximately **$910 billion** — less than half of what 358 individuals hold.

## Taxation — Who Pays

- **64%** of India's total GST revenue comes from the bottom 50% of the population.
- Only **4%** of GST comes from the top 10%.
- Indirect taxes like GST are regressive — the poor pay a higher proportion of their income than the rich.

## Hunger

- India's 2023 GHI (Global Hunger Index) score is **28.7** — classified as **serious**.
- **74%** of India's population cannot afford a healthy diet.
- **39%** fall short of even a nutrient-adequate diet.

## The Logic of Exploitation

Concentration of wealth is not accidental — it is structural:

- The means of production (land, factories, platforms, capital) are privately owned by a small class.
- The proletariat — workers who own only their labour — must sell that labour to survive.
- The surplus value produced by labour is captured by capital owners, not redistributed to producers.
- Generational wealth compounds this: the wealthy pass advantages (education, networks, inheritance) to descendants, while disadvantage is equally inherited.
- Inadequate land reforms in India have left a significant portion of the rural population landless or near-landless, structurally dependent on wealthier landowners and landlords.
- Corrupt practices and political favoritism accelerate accumulation among the already powerful.

> "Concentration of wealth in the hands of a few can perpetuate inequality over generations, as the wealthy can pass on advantages to their descendants."

## Individuals

**Mukesh Ambani** — ₹9.5 lakh crore in wealth. India's wealthiest individual. 358 billionaires collectively hold more than 700 million Indians combined.

**Gautam Adani** — actively doubling coal-power production to 38 GW. Will burn 155 million tonnes of coal per year. CO₂ emissions from coal stations projected to exceed 200 million tonnes per annum. World's biggest private developer of coal.
