## Census & Data Suppression

- The 1931 Census remains the last source of publicly available caste-wise population data.
- In 2011, a Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) was conducted, but its caste data was never released — officially due to concerns over accuracy; functionally, a political decision.
- Without caste data, targeted policy remains impossible and the state retains plausible deniability about the scale of caste inequality.

## Manusmriti — The Textual Basis of Caste Hierarchy

The Manusmriti (Laws of Manu) is a 2nd-century BCE Sanskrit text that codified the varna system. Its injunctions include:

> "A Shudra is unfit to receive education. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra."

> "He must never read the Vedas in the presence of the Shudras."

> "The Kingdom of that monarch, who looks on while a Shudra settles the law, will sink low like a cow in the morass."

> "A Brahmin can order a Shudra to serve him without any remuneration because the Shudra is created by Brahma to serve the Brahmins. Even if a Brahmin frees a Shudra from slavery the Shudra continues to be a slave as he is created for slavery. Nobody has the right to free him."

> "For the welfare of humanity the supreme creator Brahma gave birth to the Brahmins from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his shoulders, the Vaishyas from his thighs and Shudras from his feet."

The text has been rejected by Dalit scholars and movements — most notably B.R. Ambedkar, who publicly burned a copy of the Manusmriti on 25 December 1927 at Mahad.
