# Recommendations

This is the open contributions file for the Inequality project.

This space exists for anyone who wants to add data, analysis, critique, or testimony about inequality — based on caste, class, religion, gender, sexuality, disability, region, or any other axis of structural disadvantage.

There are no gatekeepers here. Your experience is valid data.

## Open Questions This Project Has Not Yet Answered

These are gaps acknowledged by the project maintainer. Contributions in these areas are especially welcome:

- **Disability and inequality** — people with disabilities are among the most economically marginalised, yet the data is sparse and the intersection with caste is almost entirely undocumented
- **Regional inequality** — the northeast, Kashmir, and tribal belt states face forms of structural exclusion not captured in national averages
- **Labour rights** — gig economy, contract labour, domestic workers; rights on paper vs. rights in practice
- **Land rights** — how land ownership (or landlessness) maps onto caste and shapes poverty
- **Health outcomes by caste** — infant mortality, maternal mortality, access to healthcare broken down by caste and religion
- **The criminalization of protest** — UAPA, sedition laws, and who gets charged
