MANUSMRITI
For the welfare of humanity the supreme creator Brahma, gave birth to the Brahmins from his mouth, the Kshatriyas from his shoulders, the Vaishyas from his thighs and Shudras from his feet.

A Shudra is unfit of receive education. The upper varnas should not impart education or give advice to a Shudra.

He must never read the Vedas in the presence of the Shudras.

The Kingdom of that monarch, who looks on while a Shudra settles the law, will sink low like a cow in the morass.

A Brahmin can order a Shudra to serve him without any remuneration because the Shudra is created by Brahma to serve the Brahmins. Even if a Brahmin frees a Shudra from slavery the Shudra continues to be a slave as he is created for slavery. Nobody has the right to free him.
